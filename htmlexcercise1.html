                <h1> This is an h1 heading element in html </h1>
                <h2> This is an h2 heading element in html </h2>
                <h3> This is an h3 heading element in html </h3>
                <h4> This is an h4 heading element in html </h4>
                <h5> This is an h4 heading element in html </h5>

                <div class= "div tags">
                    <p>This exercise is about nesting div tags. This div contains this text and the div tag below</p>

                    <div id= "nested div"> Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs. </div>
                        <div id= "another nested div">Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</div>  
                </div>
                    
                    <p> This exercise is about making lists. Here's what I like about lists: </p>
                
                    <ul>
                            <li> They're useful for displaying lists of stuff </li>
                            <li> That's about it </li>
                            <li> I'm going to put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool </li>
                        
                        <ol>
                            <li> Decide if it's an ordered list or not </li>
                            <li> If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> This list is nested in an ordered  </li> 
                                </ul>
                                    <ol> 
                                        <li>This list is nested in an ordered </li>
                                    </ol>
                            
                            <li> You've got this, I believe in you! </li>
                        
                        </ol>  
                    </ul>

                    <p> Here's a couple ways you can express yourself</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag her</li>
                            <li> <i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i> </li> 
                            <li> <b> If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag </b> </li>
                        </ul>  
                            <p>You did it! You should be proud of yourself </p>  
                            <p> <b> <i> yOu DiD iT! yOu ShOuLd Be PrOuD oF yOuRsElF</i></b></p>
